# Repository Template

Well-manageable and well-maintainable repository template.

## The Purpose

The purpose is to have a template repository and to have it *well-manageable* and *well-maintainable* by both human beings and automation tools.

The rationale behind this is that taking care of tens or hundreds of repositories while keeping them working, tidy, consistent, and up-to-date, might be a daunting task.

The way how to achieve the desired state of manageability and maintainability is to *unify* and *automate* workflow to allow frequent small changes for multiple projects at scale.

Objectives:

- Simple and easy environment check and setup
- Fast and unified code change contribution
- Automated and reliable code change propagation (build, testing, integration, publish, or deployment)

Strategies and tactics to achieve objectives:

1. Automate
2. Automate
3. Automate

## Features

- Automated workflow using [GitLab CI](https://about.gitlab.com/stages-devops-lifecycle/continuous-integration/)
  - GitLab CI skips CI if commit contains `[skip ci]` in the commit message
- Commit messages are checked using [gitlint](https://github.com/jorisroovers/gitlint) and [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/)
- Each codebase change is scanned and rules are applied:
  - Enforces max file size to 1024 kB using [pre-commit/pre-commit-hooks: check-added-large-files](https://github.com/pre-commit/pre-commit-hooks#check-added-large-files)
  - Prevents case insensitive filename conflict using [pre-commit/pre-commit-hooks: check-case-conflict](https://github.com/pre-commit/pre-commit-hooks#check-case-conflict)

  - Prevents new git submodules [pre-commit/pre-commit-hooks: forbid-new-submodules](https://github.com/pre-commit/pre-commit-hooks#forbid-new-submodules)
  - Converts line endings to LF using [pre-commit/pre-commit-hooks: mixed-line-ending](https://github.com/pre-commit/pre-commit-hooks#mixed-line-ending)
  - Prevents commits to protected branches using [pre-commit/pre-commit-hooks: no-commit-to-branch](https://github.com/pre-commit/pre-commit-hooks#no-commit-to-branch)
  - Prevents trailing whitespaces using [pre-commit/pre-commit-hooks: trailing-whitespace](https://github.com/pre-commit/pre-commit-hooks#trailing-whitespace)

  - Enforces executable scripts have no extension using [jumanjihouse/pre-commit-hooks: script-must-not-have-extension](https://github.com/jumanjihouse/pre-commit-hooks#script-must-not-have-extension)
  - Enforces non-executable script libraries have extension using [jumanjihouse/pre-commit-hooks: script-must-have-extension](https://github.com/jumanjihouse/pre-commit-hooks#script-must-have-extension)
  - Lints Markdown using [igorshubovych/markdownlint-cli: MarkdownLint Command Line Interface](https://github.com/igorshubovych/markdownlint-cli)
    - Except [CHANGELOG.md](CHANGELOG.md)
  - Lints YAML using [adrienverge/yamllint](https://github.com/adrienverge/yamllint)

  - Semantic-release skips release if commit contains `[skip release]` or `[release skip]` in the commit message
- Repository `tools/setup-repo` script provides environment check, and setup
- Repository `tools/update-repo` script updates used dependencies

## Setup

Setup releases as the group or the project variable

- Settings
  - CI/CD
    - Variables, *Expand*
      - *Add Variable*:
        - Key: `GL_TOKEN` or `GH_TOKEN`
        - Value: *token*
        - Flags:
          - Protect variable: **On**

### GitLab Releases

Set up **GL_TOKEN**: [GitLab Personal Access Token](https://gitlab.com/-/profile/personal_access_tokens) with at least scopes `api` and `write_repository`.

### GitHub Releases

Set up **GH_TOKEN**: [GitHub Personal Access Token](https://docs.github.com/en/github/authenticating-to-github/about-authentication-to-github#authenticating-with-the-api) with at least scopes `repo` for a private repository or `public_repo` for a public repository.
